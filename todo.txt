TODO:
- move primitive descriptions out of code and into README.md
- always use named arguments when constructing Syntax objects?
- move ArgumentTypeException to api package?
- rename `type` so backticks aren't needed?
- "links in the prim names" ought to be replaceable with a breed name.
  (even if we don't do that now, I guess we ought to give the prim names
  that all have "link" in them?)
- keep -1 as sentinel value, or use false instead?
- split in-link-radius into in-, in-in-, in-out-
- I got rid of the sourceSet arg to in-link-radius, is that OK?
- should the extended neighborhoods include the turtle itself?
